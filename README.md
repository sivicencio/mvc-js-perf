MVC JS Performance
===

This project was a tool that supported a series of performance experiments for different JavaScript MVC frameworks (as of 2013), in the context of the Master thesis of [Sebasti√°n Vicencio](https://github.com/sivicencio) (the author). More details can be found in [his thesis document](https://repositorio.uc.cl/handle/11534/15741).

The tool is a web application built on Ruby on Rails 4, that features simple CRUD operations that can trigger requests to the Webpagetest API, and then stores the results in a database. It is currently archived as it was not maintained after the author's thesis was finished.
